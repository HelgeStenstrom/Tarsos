GNU getopt - Java port

A while back I found myself in need of a Java command line option parser. 
Unsatisfied with free versions I was able to find on the net, 
I volunteered to port the GNU getopt family of functions from C to Java. 
The current release is 1.0.13 (released 2006/08/29).

    * View the ChangeLog for this release.
    * Download tarball or jar file) now.
    * Read the documentation online.
    * Visit the GNU project's Java homepage. 

The GNU Java getopt classes support short and long 
argument parsing in a manner 100% compatible with the version of GNU
 getopt in glibc 2.0.6 with a mostly compatible programmer's interface as well. 
 Note that this is a port, not a new implementation. I am currently unaware
  of any bugs in this software, but there certainly could be some 
  lying about. I would appreciate bug reports as well as hearing about positive 
  experiences.
