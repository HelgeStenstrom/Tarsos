h1. Tarsos

In its current form Tarsos is a collection of  classes to create, compare and process pitch-frequency data using histograms. It has an intuitive user interface and contains a couple of command line programs. Two pure JAVA pitch trackers (YIN and MPM) are also included.

To see Tarsos in action you can check the "Tarsos screencast":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzDdYvqgcOo. More detailed information, news and updates can be found on the "Tarsos website":http://tarsos.0110.be  

To give Tarsos a try you can "start Tarsos using JAVA WebStart":http://tarsos.0110.be/attachment/tarsos.jnlp or download the "executable Tarsos JAR-file":http://tarsos.0110.be/attachment/tarsos.jar. A JAVA 5 runtime is required, JAVA 6 preferred.
